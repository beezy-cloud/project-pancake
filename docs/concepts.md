## Edge[^1]
Depending of the industry and core business, the definition of Edge computing might be totally different.  
From a generic standpoint, edge computing is a device outside of the main computing premise of an organization ranging from a branch office to a water level sensor.  

Here are some generic use cases:
- for retails like a Target, the Point of Sales (PoS) where you checkout is an edge device or the Alexa devices for AWS.
- for banks like Bank of Scotland, the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) where you get cash from is an edge device or the payment device at a retail shop. 
- for telecom companies like NTT Docomo, a cell tower is an edge device or a smartphone is also a edge device.
- for Public Services like USGS, sensors in lakes and rivers are edge devices.
- for a media company like Amazon, a FireTV stcik is an edge device.

Within Project Pancake, our Edge device is a piece of equipment hundred miles away from the main computing premise and connected to a untrusted network.  
Considering this scenario, an Edge gateway might be used to repeat the data path from a down- and upstream perspective to avoid data lost.
